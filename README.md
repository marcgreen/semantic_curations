## idea

app/platform for users to semantically interact with youtube video/playlists (or other internet media). eg, enable users to ask questions/converse with youtube educational or entertainment material based on curated sets of videos. crowdsource the cost of generating the emebddings; incentivize users to share embeddings.

can generalize this idea, too: Turn any collection of content into something conversationally knowledgeable. Can be used for company's knowledge mgmt, personal digital gardens. Ideally the solution is privacy friendly.
